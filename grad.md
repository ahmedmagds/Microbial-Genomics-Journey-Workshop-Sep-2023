# Microbial Genomics Journey Workshop 2023
## Session 13: Graduation Project
### Description
* There will be 2 teams. Each team will work together on a project with certain comparative genomics questions to try to answer. We talked about too many tools and approaches, this project will be the most important part of the workshop as you will be able to apply what you have learnt so far and put it all together.
* The last session will be on 12/15 and each team will present their findings. Next Friday you will get more details.
* You can access the dataset from [Dataset of 20 genomes](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ao8qk6vfttdi6h5njygae/h?rlkey=zpifg6u7o1buyv1yoxp0ho181&dl=0).
* There is a fastq folder with 20 genomes and 1 file showing case and control designations.
* Each team will have to present their methods, main commands and major findings on 12/15/2023.
* The teaching team will be happy to answer all your questions.

### Thoughts and Tips
* Go through the material and you will be able to process these isolates from start to finish. You may not use all of the tools.
* The readme file on github with the syllabus has a nice summary for all steps and tools we discussed.
* Team should divide work. For instance, each one assemble 5 genomes...etc, using the same command.

### Questions to answer
These 20 genomes are from a single species. There are two group of isolates (case and control), 10 each. You are provided with fastq reads files.
1. What are the differences between the genomes in the case group vs control group?
2. Build a phylogenetic tree for these 50 genomes. Describe your findings on the tree!
