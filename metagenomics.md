# Microbial Genomics Journey Workshop 2023
## Session 9: Metagenomics analysis
* **For this session we will use a Docker image for the [Sunbeam tool](https://github.com/sunbeam-labs/sunbeam). The docker image with base sunbeam and sbx_kraken installed.**
* The fastq.gz reads for the dataset are in the Docker image.
* A small Kraken database can be download from here: https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2 . The "Standard-8 database is small enough to work on most computers. Please download the .tar.gz file ahead of time so it's ready.
* Slides for the class from Dr. Ceylan Tanes is now [available](20231117_ahmed_sunbeam_lecture.pdf).
* The output from the sunbeam pipeline in case you can't finish running in time but would like to use the R script after class is now available.
  * [sample_sheet.tsv](sample_sheet.tsv)
  * [preprocess_summary.tsv](preprocess_summary.tsv)
  * [all_samples.tsv](all_samples.tsv)
* The R script is also [available](Shotgun_Sunbeam_demonstration.Rmd).
