## K-mer
I would recommend going through the different [GWAS tutorials](https://pyseer.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorial.html#gwas-tutorial) in this page. If you have time for only one tutorial then do the [PySeer K-mer association with mixed effects model tutorial](https://pyseer.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorial.html#k-mer-association-with-mixed-effects-model). The data can be downloaded from [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/pyseer_tutorial/7588832). Explanation for the different files is available as a table at the start of the [GWAS tutorials](https://pyseer.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorial.html#gwas-tutorial)page.
**N.B. This command may not work `python scripts/qq_plot.py penicillin_kmers.txt`. Skip it and continue with the rest**

## Recombination
[ClonalFrameML tutorial](https://github.com/xavierdidelot/clonalframeml/wiki). the data for this tutorial should be downloaded from [here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19626912). Just do the standard model example. This ClonalFrameML command may take 12 hours to run, I would recommend doing that overnight after business hours.
