* All these genomes belong to one species, find a way to know which species it is.
* Use a reference-based tool to align 10 genomes to this reference `GCA_002076835.1` that you just downloaded.
* Clean the core SNP alignment file.
* Build a phylogenetic tree from the cleaned core SNP alignment file (Hint: Ascertainment bias correction needed).
* Upload the `.contree` on iTOL and add a Sequence Type (metadata) on the tree.
